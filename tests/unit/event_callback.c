/**
 * @brief Tests that drizzle_st::event_watch_fn is set correctly when calling
 * ::drizzle_set_event_watch_fn() and called with valid arguments
 *
 * @details Check that the drizzle_event_callback was called. It is done
 * indirectly by asserting that cxt_b has been incremented at three times.
 * The number of calls varies with the availability of underlying socket.
 * However a successful run of the unittest is guaranteed to invoke the
 * event_callback on the following state changes:
 *
 * 1. when drizzle connection is initiated by calling drizzle_connect
 * 2. before connecting to server after 1 succeeds
 * 3. when the drizzle_st connection is closed by calling drizzle_quit
