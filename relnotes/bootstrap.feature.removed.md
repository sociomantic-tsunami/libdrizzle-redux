### Remove bootstrap.sh script

- `bootstrap.sh`

The script was broken with c3cc291b3e068ba28a5128585054fdc582278b14 which sanitized the build output so files generated by make were written to a separate toplevel dir `build`.

Since maintaining a bash script of `1800+` lines is a task quite prone to errors the decision has been made to remove `bootstrap.sh` from the project.

Users of the library who integrates the script into build process should instead use the [manual build steps](https://github.com/sociomantic-tsunami/libdrizzle-redux#building-libdrizzle-redux).
