Compiling Libdrizzle Redux
==========================

Building Libdrizzle Redux
-------------------------

To build libdrizzle-redux you can invoke bootstrap script::

   bootstrap.sh

Alternatively you can build and customize::

   autoreconf -fi
   ./configure
   make
   make install

.. _test-suite:

Running the Test Suite
----------------------

Libdrizzle has a unit test suite, it needs a running MySQL server which has a
user that can create databases, tables and can connect as a MySQL slave.

The test suite uses system environment variables to find the MySQL server:

* ``MYSQL_SERVER`` - The hostname of the MySQL server (default localhost)
* ``MYSQL_PORT`` - The port number of the MySQL server (default 3306)
* ``MYSQL_USER`` - The username for the MySQL connection (default empty)
* ``MYSQL_PASSWORD`` - The password for the MySQL username (default empty)
* ``MYSQL_SCHEMA`` - The default database for the MySQL connection (default empty)

The test suite can then be run using ``make check`` or ``make distcheck`` for
testing a source distribution rather than the straight bzr branch.

To test with valgrind you can run the following::

   TESTS_ENVIRONMENT="./libtool --mode=execute valgrind --error-exitcode=1 --leak-check=yes --track-fds=yes --malloc-fill=A5 --free-fill=DE" make check

Building For Windows (cross-compile)
------------------------------------

The bootstrap script can go into MinGW mode to cross compile for 32bit Windows
targets.  To do this you need to follow the following steps (this guide assumes
you are running 64bit Fedora but other Linux based operating systems should be
similar).

#. Install MinGW, you will need these packages::

      mingw32-gcc
      mingw32-gcc-c++
      mingw32-zlib

#. Tell bootstrap to build using MinGW::

      ./bootstrap.sh mingw

The test suite can be run in wine, to do this follow these steps:

#. Install wine, you will need to install the ``wine`` package

#. Setup wine to find the MinGW dlls as follows:

   #. Run wine as follows to create the required wine home directory::

         WINEARCH=win32 wine

   #. Open the ``~/.wine/system.reg`` file for editing
   #. Find the section called ``[System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Environment]``
   #. Under this find the ``PATH`` setting and add the path to MinGW's ``bin`` directory using the ``Z:`` drive.  For Fedora 18 64bit this makes the entry::
   
         "PATH"=str(2):"C:\\windows\\system32;C:\\windows;C:\\windows\\system32\\wbem;Z:\\usr\\i686-w64-mingw32\\sys-root\\mingw\\bin"

#. Run the test suite as follows (see :ref:`test-suite` for more details and needed environment variables when running the test suite)::

      WINEARCH=win32 TESTS_ENVIRONMENT=wine make check

Linking Your Application
------------------------

To link your app to libdrizzle-redux you need to provide the following to GCC,
this assumes that the library is in your library and include paths::

   gcc app.c -oapp -ldrizzle-redux -lssl

A tool called :program:``libdrizzle-redux-config`` is included to also assist with this.
